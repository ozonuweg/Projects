# Overview

I am currently a Junior at Brigham Young University - Idaho pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. As a young child growing up, I was very inquisitive and I had a zeal to discover more out of life. Seeing as the future is already consumed by automation and efficient science & technology, I am pleased to be seeking my knowledge in this area.

I am an Upcoming BSSE graduate with an emphasis in Web Development offering a strong foundation in software engineering and programming principles across multiple platforms.
I am experienced in object-oriented programming, testing and debugging code, algorithmic design and implementation.
I quickly learn and master new technologies; successful working in both team and self-directed settings

I am detail-oriented, responsible, and committed. I am fluent and proficient in C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS Languages. I am also open to learning new things.



TEAM PROJECT

We will be creating a 3D Platformer Game that is similar to Mario Cart. 

We love the Mario Cart game and we had our own little wishes on what could be different. This made us decide to build on it.

# Development Environment

For the 3D Platformer Game Project, my team and I will be using the Unity Game Engine and SQL Relational Dtabases through a Mobile App.

We will be using C# because that is the best for Unity.
