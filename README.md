# Overview

I am currently a Junior at Brigham Young University - Idaho pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. As a young child growing up, I was very inquisitive and I had a zeal to discover more out of life. Seeing as the future is already consumed by automation and efficient science & technology, I am pleased to be seeking my knowledge in this area.

I am an Upcoming BSSE graduate with an emphasis in Web Development offering a strong foundation in software engineering and programming principles across multiple platforms.
I am experienced in object-oriented programming, testing and debugging code, algorithmic design and implementation.
I quickly learn and master new technologies; successful working in both team and self-directed settings

I am detail-oriented, responsible, and committed. I am fluent and proficient in C++, Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, and CSS Languages. I am also open to learning new things.

# Applied Programming TEAM PROJECT (BYUI CSE310)
The team is made up of me (Glory Ozonuwe), Natalia Jensen, and Will Giard. We will be creating a 3D Auto-runner Platformer Game that collects coins which makes player to gain points. Player could also lose points by hitting on obstacles. 

The point of interest with our game is the player gains the ability to jump higher when they collect more coins and this helps to avoid obstacles.

## Development Environment

For the 3D Platformer Game Project, my team and I will be using the Unity Game Engine.

We will be using C# as the scripting language because that is the best for Unity.<br><br>


## Duration

Date Started: April 2021<br>
Date Completed: July 2021
<br><br>


## Challenges and Setbacks

We planned to use a Database system to save player's progress. We also wanted to implement this as an iOS mobile game. Because of lack of time, we weren't able to complete these plans. However, we plan to keep working on the game and adding more features to it.
