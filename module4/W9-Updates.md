# Module 4 Progress Report

### Intro

My team and I decided to learn Mobile Application for this module. This is because our platformer game is going to be made into an IOS app. 

For Sprint 4, I watched some helpful tutorial videos for the team project. We still had to work on creating a demo for our project presentation so that took a bit of the time. 

They tutorial videos include:

### Challenges I faced with this:

There wasn't enough time to dive in deep to Mobile Appps because we were trying to put together our project in preparation for the Demo.

### Plan

**Goal:** Take good use of every time I have, watch simple tutorials, practice.

**Schedule:**

Week 1 â€“ Watch tutorials for mobile apps and ios and converting unity game to ios

Week 2- Implement the tutorials watched and work on Project Demo

### Summary

I really liked this module because it was still based on our project as a whole and we got great feedbacks from the Demo Presentation.
