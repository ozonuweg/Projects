# Module 2 Progress Report

For Sprint 2, I watched some helpful tutorial videos for the Unity Game Platform.

They include:

For my team, I took the role of creating the Menu Screen for the game and that made me watch tutorials specific to that.

### Demo Video

Here is a link to a demo video that my team put together for this Module: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NrxhLqe4ygcfP7TKhaquGlA8BGFdxEGX/view?usp=sharing](https://)

### Challenges I faced with this:

My macbook couldn't let me download a unity editor higher than 2019. This was a bit frustrating because my team members had different versions as well. It could cause problems when we decide to put them together.


### Summary

I really liked this module because it was still based on the Unity Engine and my team and I spent the first module watching tutorials and learning the basics. 

For this sprint, I got to code Scene loaders for the Play and Quit Button of the menu Screen Using C#. I enjoyed learning about Unity.
