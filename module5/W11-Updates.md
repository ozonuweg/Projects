# Module 5 Progress Report

### Intro

My team and I decided to learn Database for this module. This is because we want our our platformer game to save progress of player.

For Sprint 5, I watched some helpful tutorial videos for the team project. I implemented a temporary pause button but the goal for this game is to have a pause menu. I linked the main Menu Screen to our game. Now, when the user click 'Play', it rerouted to the actual game. We still had to work on creating a demo for our project presentation so that took a bit of the time. 

They tutorial videos include:

### Challenges I faced with this:

I was sick for half the time we spent on this module and I wasn't too productive on those days. I was able to catch up but it required extra work.

### Plan

**Goal:** Take good use of every time I have, watch simple tutorials, practice.

**Schedule:**

Week 1 â€“ Was sick couldn't do much

Week 2- Work on temporal pause, quit game, kill player, restart level.

### Summary

I really liked this module because it was still based on our project as a whole and we got great feedbacks from the Demo Presentation.
