# Module 3 Progress Report

### Intro

My team and I decided to choose our own adventure for this module. We’ll be learning C#. We established that this is a necessary programming language that’ll help us complete our final project. By the end of this module, we hope to write meaningful C# scripts that’ll create obstacles, score points, lose point, kill the player, etc.



For Sprint 3, I watched some helpful tutorial videos for the team project. Our Sprint topic was to learn C#. We did this by each writing C# scripts that contributed to the project.

They tutorial videos include:

For my team, I took the role of creating demo/sample collectibles and a scoring system that increases the player's score as you collect more collectibles.


### Challenges I faced with this:

I had never used C# before so this was a whole new learning procedure for me with little time to learn the basics while writing meaningful scripts for our project. 


### Plan

**Goal:** Take good use of
every time I have, watch simple tutorials, practice.

**Schedule:**

Thursday, May 27th – Watch a basic tutorial about C#

Friday, May 28th – Practice what I’ve watched

Saturday, May 29th – Watch tutorials for collectibles and scoring

Monday, May 31st – Implement tutorial on collectibles

Tuesday, June 1st – Learn about other possible obstacles for our project


### Summary

I really liked this module because it was still based on our project as a whole.

For this sprint, I got to code a Scoring System Script and a Collect coin script. I enjoyed learning about Unity.
